## About me
I am 24 years old and my main specialty is pharmacy. Over the years of working in this profession, I have not seen any growth either in career or salary terms. For a long time I thought about where I could go and where I could realize myself, which eventually led me to IT. For half a year I took offline courses on frontend development, but I don't want to stop there and I want to continue studying. I hope I can learn something new thanks to the Rs school.
